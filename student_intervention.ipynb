    "    * we can build big classifiers.\n",

    "    *  prone to Overfitting especially if there are more features, we have to be very careful in selecting features to avoid the        overfitting problems.\n",

    "SVM :\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Disadvantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * if the training set data points are more then svm takes time to train the model.\n",

    "    Real world use case : \n",
